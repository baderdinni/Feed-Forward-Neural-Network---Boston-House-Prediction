This notebook demonstrates how to build a feedforward neural network to predict Boston house prices. The model is trained on the Boston Housing dataset, which contains information about houses in the Boston area. The model is able to achieve a test MSE of 12.8748.

The notebook begins by loading the data and preprocessing it. The data is then split into training and testing sets. A feedforward neural network is then defined and trained on the training data. The model is then evaluated on the testing data. Finally, the notebook shows how to use the model to make predictions on new data.

To use this notebook, you will need to have the following libraries installed:

* pandas
* scikit-learn
* pytorch
* matplotlib

Once you have installed the libraries, you can open the notebook and run the cells. The notebook will train a model and then evaluate it on the test data. Finally, the notebook will show how to use the model to make predictions on new data.

The following is a more detailed explanation of the code in the notebook.

The first cell loads the data and preprocesses it. The data is loaded from a CSV file. The data is then split into training and testing sets. The data is then scaled so that it has zero mean and unit variance.

The second cell defines the feedforward neural network. The network has three layers. The first layer has 14 inputs and 28 outputs. The second layer has 28 inputs and 14 outputs. The third layer has 14 inputs and 1 output. The network uses the ReLU activation function.

The third cell trains the model. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer. The loss function is the mean squared error. The model is trained for 1000 epochs.

The fourth cell evaluates the model. The model is evaluated on the test data. The model achieves a test MSE of 12.8748.

The fifth cell shows how to use the model to make predictions on new data. The model is used to predict the prices of the houses in the test set. The predictions are then compared to the actual prices.

The notebook also includes a section on how to visualize the results of the model. The notebook shows how to plot the training and validation loss over time. The notebook also shows how to create scatter plots of the predicted prices vs the actual prices.

Overall, this notebook is a good introduction to building feedforward neural networks for regression problems. The notebook is well-written and easy to follow. The code is well-commented and easy to understand. The notebook is also well-organized and easy to navigate.

I hope this information is helpful. Please let me know if you have any questions.
